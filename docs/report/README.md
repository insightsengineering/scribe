UI components:

* The most important part of the report is data table with installed R packages and summary of every step. We should have a possibility to see the output of every step for every installed package.
* Search bar can be helpful in finding the package name.
* When multiple steps will be run, we would like to have a view of duration per package. That way, we will know if `check` step for a given package is taking longer than usual.
* Dependency graph will let us know if we could do some optimization.
